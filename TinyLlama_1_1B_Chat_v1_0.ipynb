            "Reverse-blocking or bidirectional transistors are proposed as solutions for enabling reverse conduction capability in GaN power HEMTs. These transistors share the drift region of the device for both conduction and blocking, providing protection against high voltages in both directions. For example, a bidirectional switch can be formed by two pairs of reverse-blocking switches. The reverse-blocking HEMT (RB-HEMT) can be formed by device-level integration of transistors and diodes, resulting in a reverse-blocking HEMT (RB-HEMT) (166), (167), (168), (169), (170), (171), (172), (173). The bidirectional switch can also be formed by a dual-gate HEMT (166), (167), (168), (169), (174), (175), (176). These devices can also be used for future power switches, as shown in Fig. 18.
